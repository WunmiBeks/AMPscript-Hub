# Reactivation Email Campaign

## Description
NexaMobile is a telecommunications company that offers a variety of mobile plans to its customers. They aim to provide excellent service and competitive pricing to maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty. NexaMobile is looking to re-engage customers who have been inactive by offering a significant discount on mobile plan renewals.

## Scenario

NexaMobile wants to target customers who no longer have an active mobile plan with them and have been inactive for the past 6 months. They will offer a 50% discount for the first 3 renewals to encourage these customers to reactivate their plans. The email campaign will be personalized based on the last mobile plan the customer was on, utilizing a specific plan Matrix data extension that includes details of the mobile plans and special offers.

## Requirements

- Personalization: Emails must be personalized with the customer's first name and specific details about the mobile plans.
- Dynamic Content: The email should dynamically display the offers (OfferA and OfferB) based on the last mobile plan ID the customer was on.
- Data Retrieval: Use AMPscript to retrieve relevant data from the Plan
Matrix Data Extension using lookup functions.
- Discount Information: Clearly communicate the 50% discount offer for the first 3 renewals.
- Reactivation Link: The reactivation link needs to have the following parameters added: CustomerID, OfferPlanID 
(e.g. NexaMobile.com/reactivate?custID=1001&offerID=201)
