# Personalization and Dynamic Content for Welcome Email Series

## Project Overview

Client Name: Beks Tavern
Description: Beks Tavern is a parent company that owns a chain of popular pub and gaming venues across the city. Each venue has its unique charm, catering to a diverse crowd with a variety of events and promotions. Beks Tavern is dedicated to providing a personalized experience for their customers, ensuring each communication reflects the individual venue's brand and offerings.
Objective: Create a Welcome Email Series for new members who have signed up at one of The Beks Tavern's venues. The series will consist of three emails:

Each email should be tailored and personalized to the specific venue/pub that the customer has signed up from. Dynamic content should include venue details, logos, images, and social media links. The educational email should also include dynamic content based on upcoming events and promotions at each venue.
